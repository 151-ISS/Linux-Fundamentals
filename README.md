# Linux-Fundamentals
Based upon the current hands-on, in person linux fundamentals training, this course has been restructured to be taught remotely.   The scope of the training will broaden slightly to incorporate tools like Git and Discord – tools that a broadly used in the software development and sysadmin communities.  This course explores the various tools and techniques commonly used by Linux system administrators and end users to achieve their day-to-day work in a Linux environment. It is designed for experienced computer users who have limited or no previous exposure to Linux, whether they are working in an individual or Enterprise environment. Upon completion of this training you should have a good working knowledge of Linux, from both a graphical and command line perspective, allowing you to easily navigate through any of the major Linux distributions.  This course will be taught by using projects, goals and games that will require research on the students’ part in order to be successful.  This process will give the student experience with Linux concepts, upon which further blocks and more difficult challenges can be added.
