## Part 1: Course Information
## Course Description

Based upon the current hands-on, in person linux fundamentals training, this course has been restructured to be taught remotely.  
The scope of the training will broaden slightly to incorporate tools like Git and Discord – tools that a broadly used in the software development and sysadmin communities. 
This course explores the various tools and techniques commonly used by Linux system administrators and end users to achieve their day-to-day work in a Linux environment. It is designed for experienced computer users who have limited or no previous exposure to Linux, whether they are working in an individual or Enterprise environment.
Upon completion of this training you should have a good working knowledge of Linux, from both a graphical and command line perspective, allowing you to easily navigate through any of the major Linux distributions. 
This course will be taught by using projects, goals and games that will require research on the students’ part in order to be successful.  This process will give the student experience with Linux concepts, upon which further blocks and more difficult challenges can be added.

## Prerequisites

* User account on the Lab network, with administrative privileges.
* Github account
    * Script & file repositories
* Discord software installed 
    * Server: TBD
    * Ensure your mic/camera are functional
* Google apps: 
    * Hangouts for video chat/screen sharing - Backup
    * Calendar for scheduling – connected to Discord

## Part 2: Topics Outline

### Fundamentals 
SSH basics – to accomplish this block, the students will need a basic understanding of SSH
We are operating in a windows environment, so discuss the various options of accomplishing an SSH session. 

***Linux Bash Shell (preferred)***

***Putty***

***Live Linux distro CD***

***Live Linux distro USB***

Students will use the https://overthewire.org/ website to learn common commands and navigating the Linux file structure.  
These games will also provide an introduction to Linux vulnerabilities by using basic exploitation techniques to move through the tasks.  These techniques will be built upon later in the course.  
Order of games:

***Bandit***

***Leviathan***

***Narnia***

***Behemoth***

***Utumno***

***Maze***


### Github – Git for SysAdmins

Here we’ll be discussing how Github/Gitlabs is not just for software development, but can be used for SysAdmins as well.
Most people who know about Git think of it as a repository for software projects. It’s actually more than that. It’s valuable with any kind of files, especially text files, that get periodic updates. Git is a valuable resource not just for programmers, but for system administrators.
In addition to source code, a Git repository can hold configuration files, scripts, and text documentation.
***Intro to Git***

* **Benefits to SysAdmins**

* **Types of repositories**

* **Types of clients**

* **Setting up a repo**


### Linux Operating System Security

This topic will introduce students to the security features and tools available in Linux as well as the considerations, advantages, and disadvantages of using those features. The class will be based on Red Hat Linux and is designed for IT and security managers, and system administrators who want to increase their knowledge on configuring and hardening Linux from a security perspective.
